# Peer Review Checklist

Are you about to review your peer's Password Manager challenge?

Although you are not limited by this list, here are some helpful items to check for:

### Password Manager 2.0

 - [ ] Can the User add passwords?
 - [ ] Can the User list all passwords?
 - [ ] Can the User sort passwords alphabetically/by date?
 - [ ] Is the class defined correctly?
 - [ ] Are there any syntax errors?
 - [ ] Is the logic correct? Could it be implemented more clearly?
 - [ ] Is the code readable? Is the code indented correctly? Are the methods and variables descriptive and clear?
 - [ ] Is there too much functionality given to one method?
 - [ ] Could this code be refactored down? How?
 - [ ] Has the Developer made good use of Ruby in built methods?
 - [ ] Does the program pass it's tests?
 - [ ] How, if at all, might this program be improved?

### Constructive Criticism

We must aim to make our feedback as effective as possible when reviewing code. Whilst it may be difficult at first to see the changes that are necessary in order to improve a peer's program, we should always aim to provide targeted, specific feedback, rather than general or broad criticisms such as *"Need's refactoring"*, or *"Too complicated"*.

Instead, question what it is about the code that may need altering. You might come to conclusions that help inform your own choices when writing code. Aim for sentences that highlight specifics, like:
 - *"Have you tried looking through the Ruby documentation, to see if there are any methods that could help here"* 
 - *"What is the benefit of using nested conditionals here over in-line conditionals"*

If the code you are reviewing is somewhat complex, or you feel in inaccessible, how might you go about offering feedback, when an alternative technical approach might be just out of grasp?

A code reviewer might take that opportunity to highlight that the code was inaccessible to them, they might even offer the suggestion that refactoring might help their code adhere to the principles of readability and accessibility.

All feedback need not be technical improvements. It is sometimes appropriate to highlight areas of improvement that are apparent to you, which may not necessarily involve more technical knowledge! 

### Next steps

Once you have gone through this list, and made your comments on the Pull Request, discuss with the peer you are reviewing why you have given the feedback you have. You can do this either via Slack, or the comments functionality on GitHub.

Remember to take a screenshot of the PR! Upon reaching a conclusion between the feedback and any refactoring that has been applied, you may merge the Pull Request to the `main` branch.

Upload the screenshot and repo link via the [this form](https://airtable.com/shr6mk28x0fy3OrxN?prefill_Item=rubyf_ch3_peer_review). 

A coach will review your code-review in due course.

What did you find good about this task? What new things did you learn? Does reviewing code critically inform your decision making?
